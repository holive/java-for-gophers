# Java for Gophers

Learn Java and Spring Boot without the beginner tutorials.

## The Problem

You write production Go. Now you need Java. Every resource assumes you don't know what a function is.

## Why This Works

- **15-minute exercises** - Fits between meetings. Completable beats ambitious.
- **Mood-aware** - Bad days get "low energy" mode. Showing up counts.
- **No guilt** - Breaks don't reset progress. Pick up where you left off.
- **Maps to Go** - Start with what you know, then learn idiomatic Java.
- **Evidence-based** - Optional retrieval practice and spaced review. Skip if you want.

## Getting Started
