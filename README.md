# Java for Gophers

A course for Go developers who need to write Java. Delivered via Claude.

## Why This Course

You're not a beginner. You build production Go services. But now you need to write Java, and every tutorial wants to teach you what a variable is.

This course:
- Maps Go concepts to Spring Boot (handlers -> controllers, middleware -> filters)
- Respects your time with 15-minute exercises
- Supports bad days with explicit "low energy" mode
- Builds muscle memory through repetition, not lectures

## What You'll Learn

Four phases, each building on the last:

1. **Syntax Survival** - Controllers, validation, filters, configuration
2. **Building APIs** - CRUD, error handling, testing
3. **Data & Async** - JPA, CompletableFuture, SQS/SNS/S3
4. **Production Patterns** - DynamoDB, health checks, metrics, circuit breakers

You'll build a "Notifier" service multiple times, each iteration adding complexity.

## How It Works

This is a Claude skill. Install it, then just start talking about Java.

- Claude tracks your progress between sessions
- Exercises are ~15 minutes each
- Three modes: full energy, regular, low energy
- No judgment for breaks - pick up where you left off

## Getting Started

Add this skill to Claude Code or Claude.ai, then:

> "Ready for some Java. What's first?"

## Course Materials

Reference docs included for when you need to look things up:
- Go -> Spring Boot concept mapping
- Java idioms (when to stop thinking in Go)
- Concurrency patterns
- AWS Spring Cloud (S3, SQS, SNS, DynamoDB)
- Common gotchas

## Stack

Tailored for: Java 17+, Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Cloud AWS 3.4.0, Gradle
