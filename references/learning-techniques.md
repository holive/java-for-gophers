# Learning Techniques

This skill uses evidence-based learning techniques, but they're always optional. Here's what they are and why they work.

## The Core Insight

Your brain doesn't learn by receiving information - it learns by retrieving it.

Reading and re-reading feels productive but creates an "illusion of competence." Actually trying to recall something (and struggling a bit) builds stronger memory.

## Techniques This Skill Uses

### 1. Retrieval Practice

**What:** Trying to recall information before looking at the answer.

**Why it works:** Retrieval strengthens memory pathways. The effort of trying to remember - even if you fail - makes the correct answer stick better.

**How we use it:** Exercises have an optional "Try First" section. You can attempt the task from memory before seeing the solution. Skipping this is fine - the technique works best when it feels like a fun challenge, not a test.

### 2. Spaced Review

**What:** Revisiting material after time has passed.

**Why it works:** Forgetting a little, then re-learning, builds stronger long-term memory than massed practice (cramming).

**How we use it:** The skill tracks when you completed exercises. If it's been a while, it might suggest a quick refresher. This is always optional - it's a warm-up offer, not homework.

### 3. Elaboration

**What:** Connecting new information to things you already know.

**Why it works:** Memory is associative. The more connections a piece of knowledge has, the easier it is to retrieve.

**How we use it:** Go-to-Java comparisons are elaboration. "Why" questions are elaboration. The goal is building a web of understanding, not isolated facts.

### 4. Interleaving

**What:** Mixing different types of practice instead of doing all of one type.

**Why it works:** Interleaving forces your brain to discriminate between approaches, which strengthens learning. Blocked practice (all problems of one type) feels easier but produces weaker retention.

**How we use it:** After completing a few exercises, the skill might suggest mixing in review of earlier topics before continuing. This helps prevent the "I learned validation but now I forgot how to write a controller" problem.

## What This Skill Doesn't Do

- Force any of these techniques on you
- Track "correct" vs "incorrect" recall attempts
- Make Low Energy Mode harder
- Guilt you about gaps or missed reviews
- Turn learning into a test

The research is clear: these techniques work best when they feel like tools you're choosing to use, not obligations imposed on you.

## If You Want to Go Deeper

These books explain the research:

- **"Make It Stick"** by Brown, Roediger, McDaniel - Most accessible introduction
- **"A Mind for Numbers"** by Barbara Oakley - Learning math/technical skills specifically
- **"Peak"** by Anders Ericsson - Deliberate practice for skill acquisition

But you don't need to read them. The skill already incorporates the key insights. Just show up, do the exercises, and optionally try the "Try First" sections when you're feeling energetic.
